        <h1>LIONEL COLLACO</h1>
        <P>
            My name is Lionel Collaco. I was born and raised in Muscat, Oman. I did my nursery at Indian Nurseries Darsait, Ghubra and Al Khuwair.
I did 10 years of schooling from 1st to 10th at Indian School Al Ghubra which is under the board of directors Indian Schools in Oman under the AEGES of Ministry of Education, Sultanate of Oman.
I did it through the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi and my passed my 10th with 89% through this board.
I have passed my 12th through the National Institue of Home Schooling, Noida which is a homeschooling board under the Honble Ministry of Education, Republic of India.
and have done it at two study centers. My first set of practical and theory exams took place at The Scholars Public School, Barwala, Panchkula Distt, Haryana - 134204
and did the rest of my practical exams at Akshara International School, Tathawade, Wakad, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Maharashtra - 411057. and all the theory exams 
at Kendriya Vidyalaya No 2, Dehu Road, Dehu Cantonment, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Maharashtra - 412101. I did extra coaching for NIOS through private 
tutors and a platform called NIOS Class
Because my marks had been cut for no fault of my own I recently went back to Akshara International School to get those marks back by marking attendance for PCP classes.
I just finished marking attendance for those classes and hope to get better marks in 12th by July and also better marks.
I'm currently Pursuing A web development boot camp at Udemy and Also a Full IBM Data Handling Professional Certificate on Coursera.
